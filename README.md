# DKG-DEMO

## Introduction

The purpose of this demo is to showcase the functionalities and potential applications of Decentralized Knowledge
Graphs (DKGs) in augmenting the capabilities of autonomous agents. This demonstration will highlight how DKGs enable
secure, interoperable data sharing and monetization, fostering innovation through collaborative knowledge utilization.
By addressing issues such as data silos, integrity, transparency, monetization, and scalability, and the transformative
potential of DKGs in creating a decentralized, efficient, and incentivized data ecosystem.

## Use Case

### Overview

#### Problem Statement

Autonomous agents (AAs) are powerful tools, but they face significant challenges in accessing and utilizing reliable
data due to data silos, integrity issues, lack of transparency, unfair monetization for data providers, and scalability
problems in managing large decentralized datasets.

#### Proposed Solution

To address these challenges, we highlight a decentralized marketplace use-case designed for an autonomous agent-first
experience. This marketplace allows individuals, companies, and research institutions to provide valuable data to
autonomous
agents (AAs). The platform facilitates secure data sharing and fair monetization, promoting innovation through
collaborative knowledge utilization and additionally, leveraging these assets will help reduce the occurrence of AI
hallucinations by providing accurate and reliable data sources.

### Key Features

* **Secure Data Sharing**: Entities can securely share their data with AAs using blockchain technology, ensuring data
  integrity and privacy.
* **Monetization**: Entities are compensated for their data, incentivizing high-quality data contributions.
* **Collaboration and Innovation**: By pooling diverse datasets, the platform fosters a collaborative environment that
  drives
  innovation across various fields.

This use case highlights the transformative potential of the DKG in creating a decentralized, secure, and incentivized
data ecosystem that benefits both data providers and autonomous agents.

## Components

### Autonomous Agents (LangChain Agent)

an agent is a specialized component designed to autonomously perform tasks by utilizing the capabilities of
language models. These agents operate based on predefined rules and can make dynamic decisions to execute specific
functions such as data retrieval, processing, and analysis. They interact with various data sources and APIs to enhance
their functionality, enabling complex workflows and adaptive behavior. Agents in LangChain are modular, allowing for
easy integration and scalability within applications, and leverage advanced language models for intelligent task
automation. 

### Knowledge Assets

Knowledge assets in OriginTrail are data entities that can represent both digital and physical objects, enriched with
semantic context. These assets are structured using RDF (Resource Description Framework) and are identifiable and
verifiable on the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). They utilize blockchain technology to ensure data
integrity, provenance, and ownership, enabling secure and transparent data sharing. Knowledge assets can contain public
or private data and are crucial for applications requiring high levels of data integrity and interoperability.

In our use case we catalogue a diversity of knowledge assets, including:

* Models
    * OpenAI
* Database
    * Postgres
* Vector Embedding
    * Chroma
* Unstructured Storage
    * JSON-LD

### Paranet

a paranet defines the rules for knowledge assets by establishing
specific parameters and structures. These rules include:

* **Data Ontology**: Specifies the structure and relationships of data within the paranet.
  Validation Criteria: Determines how data is verified and validated.
* **Access Controls**: Defines who can access and modify the data.
* **Incentivization Models**: Establishes how contributors are compensated for their data.
* **Service Integration**: Outlines how AI services and agents interact with the knowledge assets.
  These rules ensure the integrity, usability, and security of the data within the paranet, facilitating efficient and
  reliable data sharing and utilization. For more detailed information, you can refer to the OriginTrail Documentation.

Paranets can form around topics of different nature and size
